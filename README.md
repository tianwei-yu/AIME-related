# AIME-related
This is the repository of codes and data used in the AIME manuscript. There are three folders: simulation, CCLE, and BRCA. The two .R files are utilities used in both CCLE and BRCA data analysis.

Notice that the CCLE gene expression data is too big to be put on Github. Please download "CCLE_RNAseq_genes_rpkm_20180929" from the following location:
